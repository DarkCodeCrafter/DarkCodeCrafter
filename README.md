👋 Hi, I’m @DarkCodeCrafter  
🚀 Passionate about Data Engineering, Big Data, and Scalable Data Pipelines!  

👀 I’m interested in  
🔹 Data Pipeline Optimization (ETL/ELT)  
🔹 Big Data Technologies (Spark, Hadoop, Kafka)  
🔹 Cloud Data Platforms (AWS Redshift, GCP BigQuery, Azure Synapse)  
🔹 Data Modeling & Warehousing  
🔹 Streaming Data Processing (Flink, Spark Streaming)  

🌱 I’m currently learning  
📌 Real-time Data Processing with Apache Flink  
📌 DataOps & Workflow Orchestration (Airflow, Prefect)  
📌 Advanced SQL Optimization & Performance Tuning  
📌 Lakehouse Architecture (Databricks, Delta Lake, Iceberg)  

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on  
✅ Open-source data engineering tools  
✅ Building scalable and reliable data pipelines  
✅ Optimizing data workflows for performance and efficiency  

⚡ Fun fact  
I can turn raw data into insights faster than my coffee brews! ☕📊😆
